## Development

### Planning & Design

As a team, we had a week to conceptualise, design, develop and present an app that solves a problem statement of our choosing.
- We were conscious of the limited time that we had. To make our decision-making processes more streamlined, we used timers and used dot voting.
- Created a user persona to help guide us with the UX of the project
- Conducted competitor analysis and performed SWOT assessments
- Researched competitor app designs and functionality

- Used <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolers</a> to pick out some colour pallettes
- We created wireframes, taking into consideration competitor app functionality and our ideas. Used <a href="https://uizard.io/">UIzard</a> to help us out. Then cherry-picked the best features that made sense for what we were trying to accomplish.
- Created prototypes with a basic design to test out colour variations

### Tech Choices

- Due to the limited build time, we chose to go with JavaScript over TypeScript, with an option to include TypeScript after our MVP1 was achieved
- <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> - We knew that we were going to have multiple pages. To make the routing easier for us, we chose Next.js
- That means that we would use <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a>, allowing us to use components, making our code more manageable and easier to scale.
